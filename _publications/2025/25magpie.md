  This paper introduces Magpie, a self-synthesis method that extracts large-scale, high-quality instruction data directly from aligned LLMs by prompting them with partial templates. By generating 4 million instruction-response pairs and filtering them down to 300K high-quality instances, the approach enables fine-tuned models to perform comparably to or even outperform those trained on much larger proprietary datasets, advancing the democratization of AI alignment.
