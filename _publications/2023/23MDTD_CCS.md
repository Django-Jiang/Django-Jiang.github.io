  This paper introduces MDTD, a multi-domain Trojan detector that leverages adversarial learning to estimate an input’s distance from a decision boundary, thereby identifying backdoor-triggered samples across image, audio, and graph-based models. Extensive evaluations show that MDTD can effectively detect various types of Trojan triggers—even under adaptive attacks—while preserving high accuracy on benign inputs.
