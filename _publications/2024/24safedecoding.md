  This paper introduces SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs that leverages token probability insights to reduce the risk of jailbreak attacks. Extensive experiments show that SafeDecoding effectively lowers the success rate and harmfulness of various attacks across multiple LLMs, while maintaining response helpfulness and outperforming existing defense methods.
