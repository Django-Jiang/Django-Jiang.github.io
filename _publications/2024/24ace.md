  This paper introduces ACE, the first model poisoning attack targeting contribution evaluation in Federated Learning, allowing malicious clients to falsely boost their perceived contributions despite using low-quality data. Both theoretical and empirical results show that ACE deceives multiple state-of-the-art evaluation methods—while preserving global model accuracy—and that existing countermeasures are insufficient, highlighting the need for more robust defenses.
