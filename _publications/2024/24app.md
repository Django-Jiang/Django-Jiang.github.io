  This paper examines new security vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated applications, where malicious insiders or external attackers can manipulate the query-response process to force LLMs (such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) into producing biased, toxic, or misleading outputs. To counter these risks, the authors propose a lightweight, threat-agnostic defense that enforces integrity, source identification, attack detectability, and utility preservation, demonstrating its effectiveness through empirical evaluation.
