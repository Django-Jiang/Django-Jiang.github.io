  This paper reveals that current LLM safety methods, which assume text is interpreted only semantically, can be bypassed using ASCII art. The authors introduce ArtPrompt, an ASCII art-based jailbreak attack, and the Vision-in-Text Challenge (ViTC) benchmark to demonstrate that leading LLMs struggle with non-semantic cues, enabling attackers to trigger undesired behaviors with black-box access.
