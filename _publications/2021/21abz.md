  This paper introduces a method to integrate the BSP bridging model with MapReduce processing by using a work-stealing approach, where idle processors autonomously select and execute tasks from a pool of open threads. It further generalizes this method by refining unboundedly parallel ASMs into concurrent, reflective BSP-ASMs, allowing individual agents to dynamically adapt their programs.
