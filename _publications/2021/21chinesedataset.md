  This paper introduces CLC-QuAD, the first large-scale dataset for complex Chinese KBQA using Wikidata, addressing the language and diversity limitations of existing resources. It also presents a text-to-SPARQL baseline model capable of handling various complex question types and evaluates current state-of-the-art KBQA models, highlighting challenges specific to Chinese.
